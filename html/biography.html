<p>And that would be the whole story of <span class="bold">The Barkers</span>. Interesting isn't it?</p>-->

<p><span class="fLetter">T</span><b>he Barkers</b> were formerly known as &#8217;Failure 69&#8217;, which was born as some sort of school of rock, if you will. Since none of the members had the slightest idea of music; they were learning covers and getting together their own songs on the go. In 2004, the line up back then was: Daniel Garcia &#8211; vocals, Diego Garrido &#8211; guitar, drums and beers, Javier &#8211; keyboard and head scratching.<br />
In this period the band counted on invaluable aid of Javier Sanabria, a man with rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll in his veins, that flew out through his drumsticks.</p><br />
<p><span class="fLetter">I</span>n the early 2005 they got a drum player &#8211; Mar Sellares &#8211; who took on drums from the scratch. Later on, Stefano Cortoni joined the band with his jazzy &#8211; fussy bass.
In the year 2006, another man, Federico &#8211; Fico &#8211; Prieto joined the crew. He had a great influence on the band with his solid riffs and knowledge of music. By that time the band consolidated its classic bluesy rock style.<br />
In the end of 2006 and beginning of 2007 the band suffers a crisis as the lead singer leaves due to commitment issues. Strange, as it may seem, it wasn&#8217;t his lack of commitment that led to this split, but the band&#8217;s.</p><br /><br />
<p><span class="fLetter">A</span>fter that, Diego took his chance and became a lead screamer. Having a single task brain, he struggled playing guitar and singing at the same time, so a new guitarist was needed.
That&#8217;s how Krzysztof Jarzyna stepped in with some new juices. Unfortunately, they didn&#8217;t play long together. Soon after Kristof joined, Fico left the band and the country. He still makes his own tunes and shares them with the band. Some of them can be found <a href="http://www.ficoprieto.com/gallery.html" title="Federico - Fico - Prieto" target="_blank">here</a>.
His replacement &#8211; Wojtek &#346;mieja &#8211; had already jammed with The Barkers occasionally, so he actually overlapped with Fico in the lineup. Wojtek added some bluesy accents with his untechnical but hearty playing.<br />
Due to musical differences the basist left the band and was quickly replaced by an old fan, who had never played before, but took on the challenge with enthusiasm. Tomasz Piechota took on bass with an effort, sweat and sore fingers.<p/><br /><br />
<p><span class="fLetter">W</span>ith the set list nearly rounded we decided to record a demo in a &#8217;professional&#8217; recording studio in Temple Bar Music Centre.
After twelve hours of pain stacking work we got two tracks recorded. Those two tracks were nicely recorded but very poorly mixed and mastered as you can notice when you&#8217;re listening to &#8217;Holly Shit&#8217; in the &#8217;Hear Us&#8217; subpage. The other one, well&#8230; we didn&#8217;t even dare to put it on the webpage.</p><br />
<p><span class="fLetter">R</span>eality took its toll, so The Barkers plunged into a coma; Wojtek left the country, Mar didn&#8217;t fill committed enough and the rest didn&#8217;t find time to rock away.</p><br />
<p class="cent_align"><span class="fLetter">B</span>ut, beware you fools, this is not the end. Rock&#8217;n&#8217;Roll is the way of life, the path we&#8217;ve chosen and you shall hear from us&#8230;</p>
